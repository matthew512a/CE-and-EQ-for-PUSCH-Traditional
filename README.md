## üìñ Abstract

This project presents the design, simulation, and performance evaluation of channel estimation and equalization techniques for the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) in 5G New Radio (NR) systems. The focus is placed on implementing and comparing the effectiveness of LS (Least Squares), ZF (Zero Forcing), and MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) methods within a 5G uplink simulation framework.

## üìö Key Contents

### 1. **Overview of 5G NR Architecture**
- 5G network components: gNB, CU/DU split, 5GC core
- RAN protocol stacks and transmission channel classification

### 2. **PUSCH Physical Layer Processing**
- Uplink signal chain: modulation, pilot insertion, IFFT, cyclic prefix
- Types of PUSCH resource allocation: dynamic vs configured grants

### 3. **System Model**
- Transmitter, TDL channel model, and receiver chain
- Resource grid modeling (OFDM slots, subcarriers)

### 4. **Channel Estimation Algorithms**
- **LS Estimator**: Simple and low-complexity; suffers under low SNR
- **MMSE Estimator**: Statistically optimal; higher accuracy, higher complexity

### 5. **Equalization Techniques**
- **Zero Forcing (ZF)**: Inverts channel response; amplifies noise
- **MMSE Equalizer**: Balances between noise suppression and inversion

## üìä Simulation & Results

- **Metrics Evaluated**:
  - **BER** (Bit Error Rate)
  - **MSE** (Mean Square Error)
- **Scenarios Tested**:
  - Varying SNRs from 0 dB to 30 dB
  - Three modulation schemes: QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM
- **Findings**:
  - MMSE consistently outperforms LS + ZF in both BER and MSE
  - Higher modulation schemes require more accurate estimation
